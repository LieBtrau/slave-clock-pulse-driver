Hardware and firmware to make slave clocks run autonomously

In public offices and vessels slave clocks are used for timekeeping.  These clocks need impulses from a master clock to advance.  To make a slave clock run autonomously, a pulse driver is needed.  That is exactly what the hardware in this project will be doing.

An [MCS-973C1](http://media.wix.com/ugd/56d64c_fa3401d1265442198025946bb6db4be5.pdf) slave clock from Marine Radio Co., Ltd. Korea will equipped with the pulse driver.
