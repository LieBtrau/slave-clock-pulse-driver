Hardware and firmware to make slave clocks run autonomously

In public offices and vessels slave clocks are used for timekeeping.  These clocks needs impulses from a master clock to advance.  To make a slave clock run autonomously, a pulse driver is needed.  That is exactly what the hardware in this project will be doing.

An [MCS-973C1](http://mrckorea.com/element_desc.php?tar=80) slave clock from Marine Radio Co., Ltd. Korea will equipped with the pulse driver.

## Clock characteristics
* Hour-minute hands
 * 24VDC in datasheet, but works down to 20VDC
 * Black/white wire : for advancing the hands
 * Black/red wire : for reversing the motion of the hands
 * 2KOhm internal coils
 * 100ms pulsewidth needed at 20VDC
* Second hand
 * 24VDC in datasheet, but works down to 10VDC
 * Yellow/orange wire
 * 2KOhm internal coil
 * 120 polarized pulses per revolution (60 positive/negative pulse pairs)
 * 45ms pulsewidth needed at 10VDC

# Requirements
* A solution so that the slave driver runs autonomously, both the second and the hour/minute clockhand work to show the correct time.
* Must run at least one year on its own power. (No external wiring)
* Must fit in the clock housing.
* Maximum 5 minutes per year devation from correct time (no automatic daylight savings time adjustment).
* Maximum â‚¬10 COGS
